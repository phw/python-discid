"""Python binding of Libdiscid

Libdiscid is a library to calculate MusicBrainz Disc IDs.
This module provides a Python-like API for that functionality.

The user is expected to create a :class:`Disc` object
using :func:`read` or :func:`put` and extract the generated information.

Importing this module will open libdiscid at the same time
and will raise :exc:`OSError` when libdiscid is not found.
